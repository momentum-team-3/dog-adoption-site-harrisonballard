HTML

-header: happy valley shelter
-subheader: adopt a dog
-caption/p tag: if interested....fill out a form <hyperlink>

<section>
-3 rows of 3 columns of dogs up for adoption. components below, try to DRY code it 
1) image
2) name of dog as caption, left justified
3) tags, which will overflow to next line if too many 

</section>

<footer>

3 images with text overlay:
Donate, Volunteer, and Our Location
(probably can make all of them links that redirect to a solo "coming soon" page)


CSS

-header class: blue background, some padding, white text largest font, margin to middle section
-middle class: padding around sides, grid format (flexbox?) in line by the top with regular spacing 
between the images, but "overflow" of big images just takes downward in the column. regular
spacing between rows. tags are blue with full rounding and levitate tag shaped. 
-footer class: cover entire section with a purple semi-translucent covering. 3 images
that are block by block even split and white overlay text. so no padding.
